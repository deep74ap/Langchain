res  = structred_Model.invoke('''The Tesla Model Y is a stylish, all-electric SUV known for its impressive range, fast acceleration, and advanced tech features. It offers a spacious interior, strong safety ratings, and benefits from Teslaâ€™s Supercharger network. Owners appreciate the minimalist design and over-the-air updates. However, the ride can be firm, and build quality is inconsistent, with some reporting rattles or panel gaps. Reliability ratings are average, and the infotainment system lacks physical controls, which some find frustrating. Overall, the Model Y delivers great performance and value for an EV, but may fall short on luxury and refinement compared to premium rivals.''')
